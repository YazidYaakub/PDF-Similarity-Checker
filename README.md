# PDF-Similarity-Checker
PDF Text Similarity Checker: A Python script that compares the similarity of text extracted from multiple PDF files. It uses NLP techniques such as stop word removal and lemmatization to preprocess the text and calculates the cosine similarity between the texts. The script provides a CSV report with pairs of PDF files showing high similarity.
